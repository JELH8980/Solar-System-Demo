# Celestial Body Orbital Simulation



## Description
This project is a small simulation demonstrating the periodic and relative motion of celestial bodies using the two-body problem approximation. It includes classes to calculate and visualize orbits, as well as manage the attributes of celestial bodies within a system.

## Installation
To run this simulation, ensure you have Python installed along with the required packages. You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
